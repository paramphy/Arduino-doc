# **Arduino**

Arduino is a prototype platform (open-source) based on an easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a circuit board, which can be programed (referred to as a microcontroller) and a ready-made software called Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is used to write and upload the computer code to the physical board.

# **Arduino Board**

| Arduino Board  |   |
|:-:|:-:|
| ![arduinounoboard right:10% 10%](https://i.imgur.com/6uYuZAM.jpg)  | This is a Arduino UNO board. This board is used as a first board as it is cheap and available.   | |

# **IDE(Integrated Development Environment)**

It is convinient to use and truly you dont need anything else to other than this as an IDE. This is the best tool to connect to your seperate arduino board from your comuter and upload your **sketch**. (What is sketch??)   |

# **Platforms we will be using**

Arduino physical board is the best (Arduino Uno is the goto board) to learn arduino coding and we need a computer to compile and upload the code to Arduino. As you are new to this I prefer using a arduino simulator to practice and learn first.

We will be using [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to simulate the circuit. Please try to make a free account there to seamlessly use the features. You can make an account [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/).

# **Code availability**

Every code is available and opensourced in my [github repo](https://github.com/paramphy/Arduino-doc). Feel free to ask for any pull request. I am happy to help. I have also hosting an website for Arduino documentation [here](hhttps://arduino-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
