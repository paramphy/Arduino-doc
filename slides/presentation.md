# **Arduino**

Arduino is a prototype platform (open-source) based on an easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a circuit board, which can be programed (referred to as a microcontroller) and a ready-made software called Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is used to write and upload the computer code to the physical board.

# **Platforms we will be using**

Arduino physical board is the best (Arduino Uno is the goto board) to learn arduino coding and we need a computer the compile and upload the code to arduino. As you are new to this I prefer using a arduino simulator to practice and learn first.

We will be using [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to simulate the circuit. Please try to make a free account there to seamlessly use the features. You can make an account [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/).

# **Code availability**

Every code is available and opensourced in my [github repo](https://github.com/paramphy/Arduino-doc). Feel free to ask for any pull request. I am happy to help.
