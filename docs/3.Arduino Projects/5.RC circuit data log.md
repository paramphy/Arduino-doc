# RC circuit data log


# Technical Specifications

- Calibrated directly in Celsius (Centigrade)
- Linear + 10-mV/°C scale factor
- 0.5°C ensured accuracy (at 25°C)
- Rated for full −55°C to 150°C range
- Suitable for remote applications

# Components Required

You will need the following components −

- 1 × Breadboard
- 1 × Arduino Uno R3
- 1 × LM35 sensor

# Procedure

Follow the circuit diagram and hook up the components on the breadboard as shown in the image given below.

# Arduino Code

```c++
float temp;
int tempPin = 0;

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
   temp = analogRead(tempPin);
   // read analog volt from sensor and save to variable temp
   temp = temp * 0.48828125;
   // convert the analog volt to its temperature equivalent
   Serial.print("TEMPERATURE = ");
   Serial.print(temp); // display temperature value
   Serial.print("*C");
   Serial.println();
   delay(1000); // update sensor reading each one second
}
```

# Code to Note

LM35 sensor has three terminals - Vs, Vout and GND. We will connect the sensor as follows −

- Connect the +Vs to +5v on your Arduino board.
- Connect Vout to Analog0 or A0 on Arduino board.
- Connect GND with GND on Arduino.

The Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) converts analog values into a digital approximation based on the formula ADC Value = sample * 1024 / reference voltage (+5v). So with a +5 volt reference, the digital approximation will be equal to input voltage * 205.

# Result

You will see the temperature display on the serial port monitor which is updated every second.
