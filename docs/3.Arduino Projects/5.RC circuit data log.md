# RC circuit data log

# Overview
An RC circuit has a resistor and a capacitor and when connected to a DC voltage source, and the capacitor is charged exponentially in time. An RC circuit is one containing a resistor R and a capacitor C. The capacitor is an electrical component that houses electric charge. We will study how a series RC circuit behaves when connected to a DC voltage source.

## Charging

Fig below shows a simple RC circuit that employs a DC voltage source. The capacitor is initially uncharged. As soon as the switch is closed, current flows to and from the initially uncharged capacitor. As charge increases on the capacitor plates, there is increasing opposition to the flow of charge by the repulsion of like charges on each plate.

In terms of voltage, across the capacitor voltage is given by Vc=Q/C, where Q is the amount of charge stored on each plate and C is the capacitance. This voltage opposes the battery, growing from zero to the maximum emf when fully charged. Thus, the current decreases from its initial value of I0=emf/R to zero as the voltage on the capacitor reaches the same value as the emf. When there is no current, there is no IR drop, so the voltage on the capacitor must then equal the emf of the voltage source.

Initially, voltage on the capacitor is zero and rises rapidly at first since the initial current is a maximum. The figure above shows a graph of capacitor voltage versus time (t) starting when the switch is closed at t=0. The voltage approaches emf asymptotically since the closer it gets to emf the less current flows. The equation for voltage versus time when charging a capacitor C through a resistor R, is:

$$
V(t)=emf(1−e^{-\frac{t}{RC}})
$$

where V(t) is the voltage across the capacitor and emf is equal to the emf of the DC voltage source. (The exact form can be derived by solving a linear differential equation describing the RC circuit.) Note that the unit of RC is second. We define the time constant τ for an RC circuit as τ=RC
. τ shows how quickly the circuit charges or discharges.

## Discharging

Discharging a capacitor through a resistor proceeds in a similar fashion, as illustrates. Initially, the current is $$I_{0}=\frac{V_{0}}{R}$$, driven by the initial voltage Vo on the capacitor. As the voltage decreases, the current and hence the rate of discharge decreases, implying another exponential formula for V. Using calculus, the voltage V on a capacitor C being discharged through a resistor R is found to be
$$
V(t)=V_{0}e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
$$


# Components Required

You will need the following components −

- 1 × Breadboard
- 1 × Arduino Uno R3
- 1 × LM35 sensor

# Procedure

Follow the circuit diagram and hook up the components on the breadboard as shown in the image given below.

# Arduino Code

```c++
float temp;
int tempPin = 0;

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
   temp = analogRead(tempPin);
   // read analog volt from sensor and save to variable temp
   temp = temp * 0.48828125;
   // convert the analog volt to its temperature equivalent
   Serial.print("TEMPERATURE = ");
   Serial.print(temp); // display temperature value
   Serial.print("*C");
   Serial.println();
   delay(1000); // update sensor reading each one second
}
```

# Code to Note

LM35 sensor has three terminals - Vs, Vout and GND. We will connect the sensor as follows −

- Connect the +Vs to +5v on your Arduino board.
- Connect Vout to Analog0 or A0 on Arduino board.
- Connect GND with GND on Arduino.

The Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) converts analog values into a digital approximation based on the formula ADC Value = sample * 1024 / reference voltage (+5v). So with a +5 volt reference, the digital approximation will be equal to input voltage * 205.

# Result

You will see the temperature display on the serial port monitor which is updated every second.
